This repo contains a frontend and a backend of a multiplayer game.  
It was built during a 4 day interval by Jiri Swen and Jorrit Stein as a 'final hackathon' of the Codaisseur Code Academy.  

In this project, we were provided with a simplistic working TicTacToe game for two players that makes use of websockets and were asked to make a new game that can use this as a basis.  
We ended up changing it to a real-time Bomberman clone for up to 4 players :)

(TODO: tell about features, keybinds, how to start a game, how to do setup the game with yarn install, frontend (yarn start) and backend (nodemon ., postgres://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/postgres) etc.)

(TODO: add gifs/video to show working in ReadMe)
